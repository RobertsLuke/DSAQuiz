        correctAnswer: "A program in execution",
        explanation: "A process is a program in execution - it represents the active, dynamic state of a program that is currently running. This includes the program code being executed, its current activity, and the state of execution. Unlike a static program file, a process is an active entity with a current execution state."

    correctAnswer: "Yes, other processes can also contain multiple threads, although only Process 1 is shown with threads in this image",
    explanation: "While the diagram only explicitly shows threads in Process 1, this is merely an illustration of the concept. The capability to contain multiple threads is a general feature of processes, not unique to Process 1. Any process can potentially contain multiple threads, though the diagram focuses on one example for clarity."

    correctAnswer: "A program can spawn multiple processes, and each process can contain multiple threads, indicating different levels of execution",
    explanation: "The diagram illustrates a hierarchical relationship where a single program (the large circle) contains multiple processes (smaller circles), and at least one process (Process 1) contains multiple threads. This demonstrates the nested nature of execution units: programs are the highest level containing processes, which in turn can contain threads. This hierarchy shows how computation can be organized at different levels of granularity, from the coarse-grained program level down to the fine-grained thread level."

    correctAnswer: "Text, Data, Heap, and Stack",
    explanation: "A process's memory layout consists of four primary sections: Text (which stores the executable code), Data (for global and static variables), Heap (for dynamic memory allocation), and Stack (for temporary data like function parameters and local variables). This organization helps manage different types of data and code efficiently and securely within a process's address space."

      "Dynamic memory allocations",
      "Local variables",
      "Function return addresses"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "The executable code",
    explanation: "The Text section (also known as the Code section) contains the executable code of the program. This section is typically read-only to prevent a process from accidentally modifying its own instructions. It contains the actual machine code instructions that the CPU executes. The text section is often shared among different instances of the same program to save memory."

      "Dynamically allocated memory",
      "Return addresses from function calls"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Global and static variables",
    explanation: "The Data section stores global variables and static variables. This section is typically divided into two parts: initialized data (data with predefined values) and uninitialized data (BSS - Block Started by Symbol). These variables exist throughout the entire lifetime of the process and have static memory allocation, meaning their size is determined at compile time."

      "Managing function calls",
      "Storing static variables"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Dynamically allocated memory during runtime",
    explanation: "The Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation during program execution. Unlike the stack, memory in the heap can be allocated and deallocated in any order. It's managed explicitly by the programmer in languages like C (using malloc/free) or automatically by garbage collection in languages like Java. The heap grows upward in memory and is used for data whose size isn't known at compile time or needs to persist beyond function calls."

      "Global variables and static data",
      "Dynamically allocated memory blocks",
      "Shared libraries and system calls"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Temporary data such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables",
    explanation: "The Stack section stores temporary data including function parameters, return addresses, and local variables. It operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner and is automatically managed by the compiler. Each function call creates a new stack frame containing its local data, and this frame is automatically deallocated when the function returns. The stack grows downward in memory and has a fixed size determined at process startup."

    correctAnswer: "It represents the section where executable code is stored",
    explanation: "In the memory layout diagram, the 'text' section (also known as the code segment) is specifically designated for storing the program's executable code. This section is typically read-only to prevent accidental modification of the program's instructions and can be shared among multiple instances of the same program to save memory."

      "It stores file system data",
      "It stores network communication data"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "It stores global and static variables",
    explanation: "The 'data' section in the memory layout diagram is dedicated to storing global and static variables. This section is further divided into initialized data (variables with predefined values) and uninitialized data (BSS). These variables persist throughout the program's execution and have memory allocated at compile time."

    ],
    correctAnswer: "It handles dynamically allocated memory",
    explanation: "The heap section shown in the diagram is responsible for handling dynamically allocated memory during runtime. This is where memory is allocated on demand and deallocated when no longer needed. Unlike other sections, the heap's size can grow and shrink during program execution based on the program's memory requirements."

      "It represents the memory cleanup process"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "It shows how the stack grows downwards and the heap grows upwards, indicating they can potentially grow towards each other",
    explanation: "The arrow in the diagram illustrates the dynamic nature of stack and heap memory growth. The stack grows downward from higher memory addresses, while the heap grows upward from lower memory addresses. This opposing growth pattern is important because it allows both regions to grow as needed until they potentially meet, which would result in a stack overflow or out of memory condition."

    ],
    correctAnswer: "It stores temporary data during function calls",
    explanation: "The Stack section shown in the diagram is designed to store temporary data during function calls. This includes local variables, function parameters, and return addresses. The stack operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, automatically allocating and deallocating memory as functions are called and return, making it perfect for managing the temporary nature of function-related data."

    correctAnswer: "Program counter, stack, and data section",
    explanation: "The execution state of a process encompasses several key components: the program counter (which tracks the next instruction to execute), the stack (containing function calls and local variables), and the data section (holding global and static variables). These elements together define the current state of program execution and allow the process to be properly managed by the operating system."

    ],
    correctAnswer: "The data section",
    explanation: "A thread inherits the data section from its parent process. While threads maintain their own stack and program counter, they share the data section with other threads in the same process. This shared data section allows threads to communicate efficiently within the same process while maintaining their own execution state."

    correctAnswer: "Its address space",
    explanation: "Besides its execution state, a process is defined by its address space - the range of memory addresses it can access. This address space is a crucial property that provides isolation between processes and contains all the memory segments (code, data, stack, and heap) that the process needs to execute."

    correctAnswer: "As Thread(s) + Address Space",
    explanation: "A process can be loosely defined as Thread(s) + Address Space. This definition captures the two essential aspects of a process: the execution units (threads) that perform the actual work, and the address space that contains all the resources and memory the process can access. This abstraction helps understand that a process provides both the execution context and the memory environment."
